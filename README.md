# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). It uses cookie-sessions 
tracking users and their urls. Made with ejs templates to render pages and scripts for server-side rendering. Tracks how many times a link is visisted,
how many unique visitors, and displays a list of users clicking on the link and the date.
